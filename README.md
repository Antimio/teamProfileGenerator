# Team Profile Page Generator
  
## A program that allows the user to enter details regarding the members of a software development team.

This project was carried out to create an app that allows the user to create a profile page for a professional team where employees can be either a manager, an engineer or an intern. The user is prompted to create these instances of employees. When the user is done creating these instances, an html page containing the basic profiles (data entered by the user), in the form of cards, is created.

## Installation
  
This app can be installed by downloading (copying the code files) from the developer's git repositoty onto the user's pc. The files should be copied in the same arrangement as they are found in the git repository. The user should have access to node (preferably).
  
## Usage

This application can be used by installing node onto the user's pc and calling the main javascript file in the node command line i.e. "node index.js".

To use the program:

1 - Using the command line, navigate to the location of the index.js page. Run the command "node index.js".

4 - Once all the inputs have been entered and the user selects the option to stop running the program as a sign that they are finished, a message will appear confirming that the HTML page has been created and rendered.
